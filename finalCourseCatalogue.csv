Why is war a recurring topic in Western literature through the ages—from Homer to contemporary memoirs of American soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan? Why have video games exploring facets of war, like Call of Duty, reached such a high degree of popularity?
 
This course will explore first the continuity of the phenomenon of war from classical to contemporary times. Second, it will investigate the classical roots of Western culture. (For instance, a discussion of Livy’s Second Punic War narrative, Rome’s war against Hannibal, explains how the Romans set the basis for the concept of “nation” and “citizenship” that we cherish in the United States.) Finally, it will take a closer look at artistic manifestations of war, namely in literature and film, but also in the popular culture of our 21st century, “globalized” world.
 
This is an interdisciplinary class involving English, the Classics, and History and will be team-taught by two faculty members. Readings may range from passages in translation of classical authors such as Homer, Herodotus, or Vergil, to 20th century writers like poet Wilfred Owen or novelist Ernest Hemingway.

We will read, write, and think about the players, places, and events of male and female sports, discussing essays, book excerpts, poems, stories, and pieces of journalism. In addition, we will view sports from our own personal lenses and focus on how they have transformed our own lives or the lives of those around us.

English,English XII: Senior Electives,,Mind Over Matter: Athletes as Heroes in History and Literature,14055,12th,,"Athletes have been honored as heroes since the first Olympiad. From Pindar’s odes to the present day, writers have celebrated men and women who challenge themselves in sporting events.  As organized competitions have taken an increasing amount of the cultural and political spotlight, the exploits of these athletes have in some cases reached the level of legend and myth. Names like Michael Jordan, Muhammed Ali, Michael Phelps and Lionel Messi are just a few that come to mind. Yet one of the lessons of history is that there are some figures who become legends while others—even those who have made great athletic or cultural contributions—have toiled without due recognition or been consigned to relative oblivion. This course will examine the contributions of a variety of athletes who reached the pinnacle of success in their respective sports, but special attention will be paid to those who made contributions to their societies and to history itself.  Joe Rantz, Louis Zamperini, Gino Bartali, Billy Mills, Wilma Rudolph, are a just a few of the less-heralded athletes we will focus on. Beyond their athletic achievements, each of these individuals persevered in the face of extraordinary adversity and within the difficult historical context in which they lived—whether it was during the Great Depression, World War II, or the Civil Rights Movement.  In addition, novels such as Bernard Malamud’s The Natural and screenplays focusing on athletes such as Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull will be examined.

This course will examine different forms of storytelling in literature through analyzing biographies, autobiographies, screenplays and novels while focusing on themes such as perseverance, agony of defeat, competition, doubt and confidence. It will also seek to define what it means to be a hero in sports, how these sports heroes are the same or different from the archetypal heroes of classical literature, and how these athletes have wielded influence or inspired generations; it will also take a close look at their personal lives and the psyches in order to assess what made them great.

Is it a desire for freedom? And is the open road always able to provide the liberation, hope, and opportunity that it has come to represent in American mythology? These are just a few of the questions that we will consider as we journey together through American history and across its landscape. We’ll drive a jalopy to California with the Joads while reading The Grapes of Wrath; we’ll head down south with William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying and Jesmyn Ward’s Sing, Unburied, Sing; and we’ll take a trip to a post-apocalyptic future in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road.

But linger for a moment and you’ll discover the intricate geography of a world entirely separate from our own: Middle Earth. It – like the worlds of Harry Potter, of Game of Thrones, of the Marvel superheroes, Narnia, Star Trek, and Snow White – has a landscape, a culture, and a language entirely its own. So how does a writer build a world? This course will consider the ways authors discover, design, and develop rich imaginary worlds and convey them to their readers. We’ll look at the roots of the tradition of world building in mythology, fable, and fairytale, and trace them right up through contemporary fantasy worlds like Hogwarts and Wakanda. We’ll also ask ourselves: what can a look through the prism of a fantasy world tell us about our own?
Works will include: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, A Wizard of Earthsea, The Hobbit, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone; stories from Greek mythology, as well as those by the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, Neil Gaiman, Nalo Hopkinson, Emma Donoghue, and NK Jemisin; and films such as Black Panther and Pan’s Labyrinth.",Full Year
English,English XII: Senior Electives,,Philosophy and Literature,14120,12th,,"Though literature predates philosophy, there is nevertheless an important fraternal relationship between the two humanistic fields (though like some other siblings, their differences often lead to conflict).  Philosophy asks the big questions upfront and tries to find solutions, often by rigorous and analytical argument; literature more often sees how human beings (or Neanderthals or Androids) manage to live with those same questions—sometimes rationally, sometimes passionately.
 
We’ll begin with Plato, one of the most literary of philosophers, whose idealistic philosophy has influenced so many writers, considering some of the important questions he asks: What is the good life? What is virtue? How are the human soul and the ideal political state best framed? What is the function of art (literary, visual, musical)? We shall also read writers influenced by Platonic thinking, from Thomas More to Thomas Mann and Iris Murdoch.  We’ll then consider Aristotle’s more scientific and relativistic perspective, considering how his influence—especially on character—can be traced in literary works from ancient times to the present, from Euripides to Shakespeare to Stoppard.
 
 During the third quarter we shall consider Friedrich Nietzsche’s philosophy and its impact on nihilistic and existentialist thinking in such writers as Dostoevsky, Camus, and Sartre. Finally in the spring we’ll consider the role scientific and language-centered philosophies have had on post-modern conceptions of time, chaos theory, and the development of technology and ideas of the multiverse, drawing on writers including Kazuo Ishiguro, Philip K. Dick, Neal Stephenson, William Golding, and C.S. Lewis.",Full Year

We will look at the stories of people and communities who insist on expressing and reclaiming their joy as an act of resistance against the forces of oppression. The foundational unit for this course will be a deep dive into the creation of Hip Hop as an art form and culture that prioritized pure, unapologetic fun in one of the poorest and most segregated communities in America. After that, we’ll explore everything from radical queer resistance in books such as The House of Impossible Beauties and films like Paris Burning to the power of women celebrating each other in works such as The Women of Brewster Place and Lemonade by Beyonce. By examining different genres of literature, music and art, we will seek to answer the following essential questions: what does joy look like in the face of seemingly insurmountable oppression? What is the relationship between expressions of anger and expressions of self love? And how can joy actually be used as a tool for liberation?",Full Year

Russia is an immense nation that has a habit of producing both brutal dictators and imaginative geniuses, often at the same time. Despite the adversity, it is difficult to find a period in history when another civilization produced an equal number of literary masterpieces as Russia’s “Golden Century” from 1815—1917. Russian literature burned hot: a hundred years of unparalleled brilliance and then, poof, it all went dark as Stalin rose to power in the wake of the Russian Revolution. We will focus on the literary giants Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Turgenev, Pushkin, and Chekov. We’ll travel to St. Petersburg to witness one of the most famous murders in all of literature, fall hopelessly in love in Yalta, stop in Moscow to meet a beautiful woman who pursues a disastrous affair, and drift across the Siberian steppe where Dostoevsky found both God and creative inspiration after a firing squad held a gun to his head.",Full Year

We will discuss the nature of crime and the motives of a variety of criminals. We will look at how writers choose to present their criminals and how these choices influence our reactions to them, sometimes in surprising ways. We will consider: Do great stories require great transgressions? Is it more satisfying when a mystery has an artful solution or when it lives on, unsolved, in our hearts and minds? Recent texts have included: Atonement, In Cold Blood, In the Lake of the Woods, Equus, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Medea and Glengarry Glen Ross; films such as Memento, Double Indemnity, and L.A.

Why is war a recurring topic in Western literature through the ages—from Homer to contemporary memoirs of American soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan? Why have videogames exploring facets of war, like Call of Duty, reached such a high degree of popularity?
 
This course will explore first the continuity of the phenomenon of war from classical to contemporary times. Second, it will investigate the classical roots of Western culture. (For instance, a discussion of Livy’s Second Punic War narrative, Rome’s war against Hannibal, explains how the Romans set the basis for the concept of “nation” and “citizenship” that we cherish in the United States.) Finally, it will take a closer look at artistic manifestations of war, namely in literature and film, but also in the popular culture of our 21st century, “globalized” world.
 
This is an interdisciplinary class involving English, the Classics, and History and will be team-taught by two faculty members. Readings may range from passages in translation of classical authors such as Homer, Herodotus, or Vergil, to 20th century writers like poet Wilfred Owen or novelist Ernest Hemingway.
